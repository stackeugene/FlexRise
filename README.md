FlexRise (FR) - Fitness Tracking App
Overview
FlexRise (FR) is a fitness tracking app built with Flutter, designed to help users log and analyze their workouts and meals. It was developed as a class project to demonstrate state management, file support, and REST API integration, while providing a user-friendly experience for fitness enthusiasts. The app allows users to track exercises, meals, and nutrition, visualize progress through charts, and ensure data persistence with local storage and a mock API.
Features

Workout Logging:
Log exercises with details like type (e.g., Push-ups, Squats), body parts targeted (Chest, Back, etc.), sets, reps, and weight.


Meal Logging:
Log meals with details like type (Breakfast, Lunch, etc.), time consumed, and nutrition facts (carbs, fat, protein in grams).


Calendar View:
Displays logged days with color-coded markers based on body parts exercised (mixed colors for multiple body parts).


Summary View:
Line chart for workout trends (by exercise type, week/month).
Pie chart for nutrition breakdown (carbs, fat, protein) on a selected day.


Data Persistence:
Saves data locally using JSON files.
Syncs with a mock API (MockAPI) with fallback to local storage if the API is unavailable.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

Flutter (version 3.0.0 or higher)
Dart (included with Flutter)
A code editor (e.g., VS Code with Flutter and Dart extensions)
A device/emulator or Chrome for web deployment

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flexrise.git
cd flexrise


Install Dependencies:Run the following command to install the required packages:
flutter pub get


Set Up MockAPI (Optional):

The app uses a mock API for remote data storage. You can create your own mock API using MockAPI.
Update the baseUrl in lib/services/api_service.dart with your MockAPI URL:final String baseUrl = 'https://your-mockapi-url.com';


If you skip this step, the app will fall back to local storage.


Run the App:

To run on Chrome (web):flutter run -d chrome


To run on an emulator or physical device:flutter run





Usage Guide

Login:

Use any email and password to log in (dummy authentication for demo purposes).


Add a Workout:

Go to the "Add" tab.
Select "Workout" as the type.
Choose an exercise type, body parts targeted, sets, reps, and weight.
Save the entry.


Add a Meal:

Go to the "Add" tab.
Select "Meal" as the type.
Specify the meal type (e.g., Breakfast), time consumed, and nutrition facts (carbs, fat, protein).
Save the entry.


View Calendar:

Go to the "Calendar" tab.
Days with logged workouts are marked with color-coded dots (colors mix for multiple body parts).


View Summary:

Go to the "Summary" tab.
Select "Workouts" to see a line chart of your workout trends.
Select "Meals" and choose a day to see a pie chart of your nutrition breakdown.



Technical Details
Tech Stack

Framework: Flutter (Dart)
State Management: flutter_bloc (BLoC pattern)
File Storage: path_provider for local JSON storage
REST API: http package for MockAPI integration
UI Components:
table_calendar for the calendar view
fl_chart for line and pie charts



Architecture

State Management:
DataBloc manages the app state, handling events like AddWorkout, AddMeal, and LoadData.
DataState stores the appâ€™s data (List<Workout> and List<Meal>).


File Support:
FileService handles reading/writing data to a local JSON file (flexrise_data.json).


REST API:
ApiService makes HTTP requests to a mock API for fetching and adding workouts/meals.
Fallback to local storage if the API fails.


Key Features:
Color-coded calendar markers using a custom color-mixing algorithm.
Nutrition pie chart for visualizing carbs, fat, and protein.

Challenges and Solutions

Bottom Overflow Error:
Fixed by wrapping the AddingScreen in a SingleChildScrollView.


Type Safety Issues:
Ensured proper typing in DataState (List<Workout> and List<Meal>) and fixed missing imports.


Complex Features:
Implemented a color-mixing algorithm for the calendar markers and a pie chart for nutrition using fl_chart.



Future Enhancements

Add real user authentication (e.g., Firebase).
Implement a goals feature (e.g., weekly workout or nutrition goals).
Enhance analytics with trends over longer periods.
Improve UI/UX with animations and better styling.
